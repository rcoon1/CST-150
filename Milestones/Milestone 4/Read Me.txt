Refine your project. Your application should allow you to manipulate the inventory in your inventory manager through the user interface. You should be able to do the following:

Add a new item to the inventory manager.
Remove an item from the inventory.
Restock an item in the inventory.
Display the items in the inventory.
Search for an item/items in the inventory by a variety of criteria.
Update your inventory manager so that it uses a list to store inventory items instead of an array.

Demonstrate your project in class and be prepared to answer questions about your code. Refer to “Presenting Online Guide,” for presentation options. Though this resource is intended for online courses, your instructor may support these options.

Deliverables:

A cover sheet with name, date, and assignment title.
An updated inventory manager class that uses a list to store inventory items and includes the functionality mentioned above.
A redesigned user interface that includes controls to manage the new functionality.
A rehearsed presentation in which you demonstrate your project to the class.
