Calories from fat and Carbohydrates in C# WITH A WINDOWS FORM

A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula:

Calories from Fat = Fat Grams x 9
Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates using the following formula:
Calories from carbs = Carbs grams x 4
Create an application that will make these calculations. In the application, you should have the following methods:
FatCalories – This method should accept a number of fat grams as an argument and return the number of calories from that amount of fat.
CarbCalories – This method should accept a number of carbohydrates grams as an argument and return the number of calories from that amount of carbohydrates.
