Create the Lucky Number application, shown in the “Activity 15 Possible Implementation.”  Your project can calculate Lucky Numbers any way you wish, but must include the following features:

Two forms, minimum. Each form should have a different title.
A programmatically populated control.
A control populated based on the selected item in another control.
An event that launches the second form.
A screenshot of your program running with successful output.
As always, programming style, usability, and creativity matter!
